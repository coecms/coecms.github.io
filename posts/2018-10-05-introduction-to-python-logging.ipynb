    "Look here for a list: https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDebuggingTools ).   \n",
    "While these tools are certainly good, in this blog I will show you how to use the **logging** module. This module, used in a basic mode, is as easy as printing statements but will give you a lot more control on your code and the ability to eventually add more advanced features.  \n",
    "As well as demostrating some simple usage of **logging**, I will touch on other simple but useful debugging tools: the functions **type()** and **dir()** and the **try/except** control flow. <br>\n",
    "**logging** is part of the python distribution so you do not need to install or load anything else, simply import the module.  <br> <br>\n",

    "Also jupyter can send your logging output to the terminal rather then the cell and generally interacts with logging in its own way. While you might be able to fix this after reading the blog, using python would make reproducing this easier."
