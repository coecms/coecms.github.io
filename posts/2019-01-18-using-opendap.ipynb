    "One of our researcher asked me recently to download the MUR (Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution SST) dataset. She is interested in all the available period but only for a small region. This dataset is relatively small but has many files (several for each day across 19 years) and it is updated frequently. This means that we would also have to update and check the dataset frequently and the files would be stored across several sub-directories making the access more complicated. <br><br>\n",
    "Fortunately this data is available via OPeNDAP. OPeNDAP is a web-based software that allows users to access datasets remotely. Many softwares used for analysis recognise an OPeNDAP url as a filename. A OPeNDAP url is usually constituted by the remote address of the file followed by optional constraints.<br><br>\n",
    "This is one of the advantages of OPeNDAP you don't need to download a file before using it, you can simply subset the portion you need and the software you are using will load only the data you need. Next time you run the same analysis, if the data has been updated, you will be automatically using the updated dataset.<br><br>\n"
