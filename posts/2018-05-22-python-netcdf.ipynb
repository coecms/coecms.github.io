    "Let's take a look at some of the libraries available in the CMS Conda environment for loading NetCDF files.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main libraries available - `xarray`, `netCDF4` and `iris`. Each let you load a file and work with variables as if they were a numpy array, but each have their own unique features that can be helpful when working with climate datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "Xarray is my favourite library for working with NetCDF files - it makes it easy to filter data by coordinate value, rather than having to work out array indices yourself. In combination with the Dask library it also lets you work with very large datasets without having to load everything into memory all at once.\n",

    "Xarray works with file formats other than NetCDF as well, so some features like compression settings can be inconvenient to set."
