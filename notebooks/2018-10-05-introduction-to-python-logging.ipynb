    "While these tools are certainly good, in this blog I will show you how to use the **logging** module. This module, used in a basic mode, is as easy as printing statements but will give you a lot more control on your code and the ability to eventually add more advanced features.  \n",
    "As well as demostrating some simple usage of **logging**, I will touch on other simple but useful debugging tools: the functions **type()** and **dir()** and the **try/except** control flow. <br>\n",
